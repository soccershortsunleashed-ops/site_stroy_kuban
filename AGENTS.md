# Project Rules

## UI Components Policy

- For this business site, all UI components must come from `shadcn/ui` (registry `@shadcn`).
- Do not create custom UI components when a `shadcn` component exists.
- Build pages by composing `shadcn` components and variants.
- If a required component is not available in `shadcn`, stop and ask for explicit approval before implementing a custom one.
